- **Gradle 7.0** or later
- **Docker** for hosting database (postgre container by default, but can change it in application.properties accordingly)
- **Postman** (optional, for testing APIs)

### Java

You can download and install Java from the official website: [Java SE Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk17-downloads.html).

Verify the installation:

```bash
$ java -version
```
### Gradle
Just "./gradlew build" in the terminal/console

## For Local Development Setup Instructions

    git clone https://github.com/heohak/ORNet.git
    cd heohak/ORNet
    
- Or when Using IDEs just press "Get From VCS" and put the same URL: https://github.com/heohak/ORNet.git
- Use Gradle to build the project and download dependencies:

        ./gradlew clean build
    
- Or in the IDE you can also press gradle on the right side and then Tasks/build/build
- Make sure Docker is installed and running on your machine. Then, create and start a PostgreSQL container:

        docker run --name postgres-container -e POSTGRES_USER=youruser -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=yourpassword -e POSTGRES_DB=yourdb -p 5432:5432 -d postgres
  
- Change the application properties if you are using some other database container than postgre and change the password and username accordingly
- And run the program (the database container has to be running also)
